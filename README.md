# Virus-host-interaction-network



Our aim is to make it easier for users to grasp the concept of bipartite networks. To achieve this, we've taken a sample dataset that showcases interactions between host and virus proteins. We've also included a user-friendly R script with simple code that allows you to work with your own data effortlessly.

The sample data used here is obtained from the VirusMINT database, which you can access at https://maayanlab.cloud/Harmonizome/dataset/Virus+MINT+Protein-Viral+Protein+Interactions.
