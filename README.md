# Virus-host-interaction-network


Our goal is to simplify the understanding of bipartite networks for users. To do this, we've provided a dummy dataset representing interactions between host and virus proteins. Additionally, we've included an R script with user-friendly code to make it easier for you to work with data of your choice.
